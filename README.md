I created this app as another submission for a challenge from [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges). The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/O2iGT9yBd6xZBrOcVirx) is to build an application in which a user can choose an image file, see the file upload progress, upload the file remotely, get back the image and link to the remote image. The user should also be able to copy the image link to their clipboard.

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/mburuanthony/imageUploader.git

# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Run the app
$ npm start
```
